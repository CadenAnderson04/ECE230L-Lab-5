# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
    * The Top level file acts as the root of the design hierarchy, declaring inputs, outputs, & other important information to be passed into other files.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
    * The Constraint file is used to specify physical requirements for synthesis to ensure the final circuit acts how it is meant to.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
